# stats_design
R scripts, stan code, and markdown files detailing elements of statistical model design. The scripts and ideas in this repository draw heavily on Richarch Mcelreath's [Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) book and lectures. Most of the content here is philosophically driven and takes an informal tutorial approach. Motivation can be found [here](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/taylor.htm) and [here](http://redpenblackpen.tumblr.com/image/142282350107).
